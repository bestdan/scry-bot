You’re involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts.

Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves’ guilds and street gangs. You might be a &ldquo;velvet mask&rdquo; bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists.

That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>\r\n<p>If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1- foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>\r\n<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>",

Until the end of your next turn, Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against the cursed creature have advantage.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The next Wisdom saving throw the cursed creature makes before this curse ends has disadvantage.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBinding\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of Binding</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you attempt to bind a Large or smaller creature you can see within 30 feet of you, which must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the cursed creature’s speed is reduced to 0 and it can’t use reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect any creature regardless of size. The cursed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBloated Agony\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of Bloated Agony</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, causing its body to swell until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature has disadvantage on Strength checks and Dexterity checks, and takes 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one attack during its turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute. The cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofCorrosion\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of Corrosion</h5>\r\n<p><em><em>Prerequisite:</em> 15th level, Order of the Mutant</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you cause a creature within 30 feet of you to become poisoned. The cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage when you inflict this curse, and it takes this damage again each time it fails a Constitution saving throw to end the curse.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheExorcist\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of the Exorcist</h5>\r\n<p><em><em>Prerequisite:</em> 15th level, Order of the Ghostslayer</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is charmed or frightened, or which is under a possession effect. The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> A creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target of your curse takes 3d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofExposure\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of Exposure</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage from an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken its resilience. Until the end of the target’s next turn, it loses resistance to all the damage types dealt by the triggering attack or spell (including for that triggering effect).</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, but has resistance to those damage types until the end of its next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheEyeless\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of the Eyeless</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack hits or misses. The creature is immune to this curse if it is immune to the blinded condition.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You apply this curse to all the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the creature’s turn. You roll separately for each affected attack.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheFallenPuppet\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to instill that creature with a final act of aggression. The creature immediately makes one weapon attack against a target of your choice within its range.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You can first cause the cursed creature to move up to half its speed, and you grant a bonus to its attack roll equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheHowl\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of the Howl</h5>\r\n<p><em><em>Prerequisite:</em> 18th level, Order of the Lycan</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you unleash a bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If a creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, it is stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMarked\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of the Marked</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you mark a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your turn, whenever you hit the cursed creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMuddled Mind\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell or using a feature that requires concentration. That creature has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it makes to maintain concentration before the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheSoulEater\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Blood Curse of the Soul Eater</h5>\r\n<p><em><em>Prerequisite:</em> 18th level, Order of the Profane Soul</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature that isn’t a construct or undead is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to offer their life energy to your patron in exchange for power. Until the end of your next turn, you make attacks with advantage and you have resistance to all damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> Additionally, you regain an expended warlock spell slot. Once you’ve amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.</p>",

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

            "description": "<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\r\n<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
