Once a melody has been played, the ocarina shouldn't be used to play one of these melodies again until the next dawn. Each time it is used to play such a melody again before then, the ocarina has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and dissolving into molten rock in your hands, destroying itself and dealing 5d10 fire damage to you when this occurs.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Erupting Melody.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you play this melody, choose four different points on the ground that you can see within 60 feet of you. A pillar of flame bursts upward from each point, provided that the ocarina's sound can reach it. A creature within 5 feet of each point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one of these eruptions is affected only once.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Molten Melody.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you play this melody, choose a stone or earthen structure that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the sound of the ocarina can reach the structure, it harmlessly dissolves into a pile of molten earth, which immediately cools at the end of the effect. The dissolved area of the structure can be no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Seismic Melody.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you play this melody, choose a point on the ground that you can see within 60 feet of you. The ground then shakes, like an earthquake, in a 20-foot-radius circle that's centered on that point. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and take 3d6 bludgeoning damage. A 10-foot-deep fissure then opens immediately after in a straight line, which runs through the center of the circle. The line is 5 feet wide and up to 40 feet long. Any creature within the line must succeed on an additional DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet down into the fissure. A creature that failed the saving throw for the earthquake makes this second saving throw with disadvantage.</p>",

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>",

Paladins of this oath can come from many backgrounds and espouse many variants of their conviction, but most tend toward Lawful.

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.
