    "backstory": "Spectre, the first son of Jarlaxle Baenre, was born into a life of privilege and power. \n\nJarlaxle Baenre is a drow rogue and mercenary who founded the criminal organization Bregan D'aerthe as a way to secure his own power and influence in the Underdark, and the organization has since grown to become one of the most formidable forces in drow society and beyond. The group is known for its cunning, stealth, and versatility, and is feared and respected by those who know of its existence.\n\nAs the son Jarlaxle, Spectre was trained from a young age in the art of deception, stealth, and assassination. He learned from his father the importance of cunning, charm, and always having a backup plan.\n\nGrowing up, Spectre watched as Jarlaxle manipulated those around him to get what he wanted, and he began to develop his own sense of ambition. He yearned to prove himself as a worthy successor to his father and make a name for himself in the Underdark.\n\nAs he grew older, Spectre honed his skills as a rogue and assassin, taking on dangerous missions for his father and quickly becoming known for his stealth and efficiency. He became a valuable asset to Bregan D'aerthe operations, but always felt overshadowed by his father's reputation.\n\nOne day, Spectre was tasked with assassinating the first-born daughter of drow noble house, which had taken exception to Jarlexle's growing power and influence. The mission was a success, but in the aftermath, Spectre discovered a plot by his own father to betray him. Jarlaxle had set him up to take the fall for the assassination, hoping to eliminate the competition and secure his own position.\n\nEnraged by his father's treachery, Spectre turned against Jarlaxle and fled into the Underdark, vowing to make a name for himself as the greatest rogue and assassin the drow had ever known. He operated for decades as a mercenary, taking on dangerous missions and using his skills to undermine those who would seek to control him. Despite his reputation as a ruthless killer, Spectre is still searching for a sense of purpose and a place where he truly belongs.\n\nJarlaxle was nothing if not resourceful, and he was determined to bring Spectre back to Bregan D'aerthe, one way or another. So, he devised a cunning plan to trick and trap his errant son.\n\nHe spread rumors throughout the Underdark that a powerful artifact was hidden in a remote corner of the caverns, guarded by a fierce monster. The artifact was said to grant immense power to whoever claimed it, and Jarlaxle knew that Spectre's greed and ambition would lead him straight to it.\n\nSure enough, Spectre heard the rumors and set out to find the artifact, eager to prove himself as a powerful and independent rogue. When he reached the location, he found the \"monster\" guarding the artifact was actually a group of Bregan D'aerthe mercenaries, armed and waiting for him. \n\nSpectre's exceptional stealth enabled him to penetrate Bregan D'aerthe's defenses, and he recognized one of Jarlaxle's generals. Upon retreat, Jarlaxle was forced to kill the general with a precise throw of his short-sword and flee back into the Underdark.\n\nMany years passed, and Spectre was a skilled rogue who had made a name for himself as a successful assassin in the Underdark. He had been hired by the ruling family of a Duergar city to drive a group of svirfneblin miners away from a valuable vein of gemstones, and he had accepted the job without hesitation.\n\nHowever, as he began to carry out the mission, he started to have suspicions. The Duergar family seemed overly eager to get rid of the svirfneblin, and they had sent their oldest son to accompany Spectre on the mission. Spectre's instincts told him that something was not right, and he decided to investigate further.\n\nWhat he discovered shocked him: the mission was funded by none other than Bregan D'aerthe, and it was a trap to kill him. Jarlaxle had grown tired of Spectre's independence and wanted to bring him back into the fold, and he saw this as the perfect opportunity to do so.\n\nSpectre knew that he had to act quickly if he wanted to survive. He executed the oldest son of the Duergar family and fled, pursued by powerful forces among the drow and duergar.\n\nHe knew that he couldn't stay in the Underdark for long, as he was a marked man, and he decided to flee to the surface. He was a skilled rogue, and he was confident that he could find a new life and start anew.\n\nSpectre arrived on the surface with nothing but the clothes on his back and his wits to rely on. He was a skilled rogue and an accomplished assassin, but he was in a strange and unfamiliar land, and he had to start from scratch.\n\nHe soon discovered that the surface was a land of opportunity, and he began to search for ways to make his mark and build a new life. He soon joined a martial company, a misfit group of warriors and adventurers who traveled the land, taking on dangerous missions and battling against all odds.\n\nOne day, the martial company was hired to protect a wealthy merchant family as they traveled across the realm. The head of the family was a shrewd businessman, and he was always on the lookout for ways to increase his wealth and prestige.\n\nSpectre saw an opportunity to impress the head of the merchant family and to gain a valuable contract for his martial company. To gain the contract, he challenged the merchant a game of dice, a fast-paced and risky game that he had learned from Jarlaxle.\n\nThe head of the merchant family was intrigued, and he agreed to play. Spectre was a skilled player, and he had a secret weapon: one of his dice was loaded. He also knew how to use the games to maximize payoffs. Spectre and his company played the game with the merchant for hours, losing on purpose until the merchant was drunk and pliable.\n\nFinally, Spectre persuaded the merchant to bet a lucrative contract that would dramatically improve the family's position in their businesses. Spectre's loaded die helped him win the game and the contract. The contract brought wealth and prestige to the company, and it cemented Spectre's role in the group.\n\nFrom that day on, the martial company was known far and wide as a competent and trusted band for hire, and they were sought after by wealthy merchants and noble families with tasks that required special expertise, tactics, and discretion.\n\n",

Together, the two weapons work in tandem. You are considered proficient with Call even if you lack proficiency with rapiers.<br /><br />You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons. While holding either of the weapons, you can use an action to magically sense the direction and distance of the other weapon, provided you're on the same plane of existence. Whenever you draw Call, you can choose for Response to magically vanish from its location and reappear in your other hand (provided it's free) or in your space; while Response is in your space and not being held by you or stowed on your person, it floats around you and can't be held by another creature. Until you stow Call, you can draw the floating Response as if it were on your person, or release it in your space. Response magically returns to your space immediately after you make a ranged attack with it, provided you're holding Call.<br /><br /><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Battle Songs.</i></b>&nbsp;While typical blades slice through the air, Call and Response sing through it; they also harmonize.

The song continues until the start of your next turn.<br /><br /><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Dirge of the Forgotten.</b>&nbsp;You can immediately make an attack with Response using a bonus action. On a hit, the target takes an extra 3d6 radiant damage from the attack.<br /><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><br />Hymn of the Heavensent.</b>&nbsp;Response sweeps through the air around you, deflecting incoming attacks: you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn or until you make an attack with the dagger.<br /><br /><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Warring Duet.</i></b>&nbsp;While holding both of the weapons, you can use an action to speak their command word (\"Begin,\" in Elvish). When you do, the weapons leap from your hands. Choose up to five different creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you: Call and Response then magically fly to each creature and make a special melee attack against them, using your attack bonus as if you were wielding the weapons. On a hit, a target takes 8d8 radiant damage and glows with a heavenly light until the end of your next turn. For the duration of the light, attack rolls against a glowing creature are made with advantage, and such a creature's attack rolls against you are made with disadvantage. After the final attack, Call and Response magically fly back to your hand and side, respectively. You then choose a Battle Song. Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>",
